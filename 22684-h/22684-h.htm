Hawaiian Islands, in the Legislature of the Kingdom Assembled:</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1. All patents shall be issued in the name of
His Majesty the King, under the Seal of the Interior Department,
and shall be signed by the Minister of Interior and
countersigned by the Commissioner of Patents, and they
shall be recorded together with the specifications in the
office of the Interior Department in books kept for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 2. Every patent shall contain a short title or
description of the invention or discovery, correctly indicating
its nature and design, and a grant to the patentee, his
heirs or assigns for the term of ten<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a title="Amended to read &quot;fifteen&quot;. Act 27, Laws of 1896."

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">p. 2</a></span>right to make, use and vend the invention or discovery
throughout the Hawaiian Islands, referring to the specification
for the particulars thereof. A copy of the specifications
and drawings shall be annexed to the patent and be a part
thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3. Any person who has invented or discovered
any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof not known or used by others in this country, and not
patented (or described in any printed publication) in this or
any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof,
may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other
due proceedings had, obtain a patent therefor. Provided,
however, that any person who has invented or discovered
any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, and has received a patent or patents therefor from
any foreign government may also obtain a patent therefor in
this country as provided above, unless the thing patented has
been introduced into public use in the Hawaiian Islands for
more than one year prior to the application for a patent.
But every patent granted for an invention which has been
previously patented in a foreign country, shall be so limited
that it shall not continue longer than the time of the expiration
of such foreign patent, or if there are several foreign
patents, it shall not continue longer than the time of the
expiration of the one with the shortest unexpired term, and
in no case shall it be in force more than ten<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a title="Amended to read &quot;fifteen&quot;. Act 27, Laws of 1896."

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 4. Before any inventor or discoverer shall receive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">p. 3</a></span>a patent for his invention or discovery he shall apply therefor
in writing to the Minister of Interior, and shall file in
the office of the Interior Department a written description of
the same and of the manner and process of making, compounding
and using it, in clear, concise and exact terms and
in case of a machine he shall explain the principle thereof
and of the manner in which he has applied that principle so
as to distinguish it from other inventions, and he shall particularly
point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement
or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.
When the nature of the case admits of drawings the applicant
shall furnish them as set forth in Section 2. When the
invention or discovery is of a composition of matter, the
applicant shall furnish a specimen of ingredients and of the
composition, sufficient in quantity for the purpose of experiment.
In all cases which admit of representation by model,
the applicant shall, if required, furnish a model of convenient
size to exhibit advantageously the several parts of his invention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 5. The applicant shall make oath that he believes
himself to be the original and first inventor or discoverer
of the art, machine, manufacture, composition or
improvement for which he solicits a patent, and that, he does
not know or believe that the same was ever before known or
used, and shall state of what country he is a citizen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 6. On filing of any such application and the payment
of the fees required by law, the Commissioner of Patents
shall examine the alleged new invention or discovery, and
if upon such examination it shall appear that the claimant
is justly entitled to a patent under the law and that the same
is sufficiently useful and important, he shall report accordingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">p. 4</a></span>
to the Minister of Interior, who shall cause a patent
to be issued therefor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 7. Any person who makes any new invention or
discovery, and desires further time to mature the same, may
on payment of the fees required by law, file in the Interior
Department a <i>caveat</i> setting forth the design thereof and its
distinguishing characteristics, and praying protection of his
right until he shall have matured the invention. Such <i>caveat</i>
shall be preserved in secrecy and shall be operative for the
term of one year from the filing thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 8. The Commissioner of Patents shall be appointed
by the Minister of Interior and shall examine and
report on all applications for patents and shall receive for
such services a fee of twenty dollars for each application examined
and reported by him, which fee shall be paid by the
applicant in advance. In addition to this fee the following
fees shall be charged all applicants for patents, upon filing
each original application for a patent, five dollars; and upon
issuing a patent, five dollars; and five dollars shall be charged
for the filing of a <i>caveat</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 9. This Act shall take effect and become a law
from and after its publication, and "An Act to amend Section
255 and 256 of the Civil Code, and add a new Section to
the Civil Code to be numbered Section 256a," approved the

BY AN ACT ENTITLED "AN ACT TO AMEND AN
ACT REGULATING THE ISSUING OF PATENTS,"
APPROVED THE 23RD DAY OF JUNE, 1888, TO BE

is hereby amended by striking out the word "ten" and inserting

any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof not known or used by others in this country, and not
patented (or described in any printed publication) in this or
any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof,
may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other
due proceedings had, obtain a patent therefor. Provided,
however, that any person who has invented or discovered any
new and useful art, machine, manufacture, process or composition
of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, and has received a patent or patents therefor from
any foreign government, may also obtain a patent therefor
in this country as provided above, unless the thing patented
has been introduced into public use in the Hawaiian Islands
for more than one year prior to the application for a patent.
But every patent granted for an invention which has been

that it shall not continue longer than the time of the expiration
of such foreign patent, or if there are several foreign

expiration of the one with the shortest unexpired term, and
in no case shall it be in force more than fifteen years."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3. That a new section to said Act, as amended by
the Act entitled "An Act to amend an Act to regulate the
issuing of Patents," approved June 23rd, 1888, be added, to
be called Section 15.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Section</span> 15. Whenever any patent is inoperative or invalid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">p. 9</a></span>
by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or
by reason of the patentee claiming as his own invention or
discovery more than he had a right to claim as new, if the
error has arisen by inadvertance, accident or mistake, and
without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Minister
of the Interior shall, on the surrender of such patent and
the payment of the same fees required by law upon the issue
of an original or first patent, cause a new patent for the same
invention, and in accordance with the corrected specification,
to be issued to the patentee, or, in the case of his death, or of
an assignment of the whole or any undivided part of the
original patent, then to his executors, administrators, or assigns,
for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent.
Such surrender shall take effect upon the issue of the
amended patent. The Minister of the Interior may, in his
discretion, upon demand of the applicant, and upon payment
of the same or first fee required to be paid on the issuing of
a patent, cause several patents to be issued for distinct and
separate parts of the thing patented. The specifications and
claim in every such case shall be subject to revision and restriction
in the same manner as original applications are.
Every patent so re-issued, together with the corrected specification,
shall have the same effect and operation in law,
on the trial of all actions for causes thereafter arising, as if
the same had been originally filed in such corrected form;
but no new matter shall be introduced into the specification,
nor in case of a machine patent shall the model or drawings
be amended, except each by the other, but when there is
neither model nor drawing, amendments may be made upon

<p><a name="Rule_17" id="Rule_17"></a>17&mdash;The specification is a written description of the invention
or discovery, and of the manner and process of making,
constructing, compounding and using the same, and is required
to be in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to
enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it
appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to

his attorney, and the signature must be attested by two witnesses.
Full names must be given, and all names, whether of
applicants or witnesses, must be legibly written.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_21" id="Rule_21"></a>21&mdash;All of the papers must be written in a fair, legible
hand, on but one side of the paper, otherwise the office may
require them to be printed. All interlineations and erasures
must be clearly marked in marginal or foot notes, written on
the same page. Legal cap paper, with the lines numbered, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">p. 22</a></span>
preferable, and a wide margin must be reserved upon the
left hand side of each page of the specification.</p>


<p class="rop">THE OATH.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_22" id="Rule_22"></a>22&mdash;The inventor must make oath that he does verily believe
himself to be the original and first inventor or discoverer
of the art, machine, manufacture, composition or improvement
for which he solicits a patent. That the same has not been
patented to himself or others with his knowledge or consent
in any foreign country, or if the same has been so patented,
the details of, name, country, date, number and term must be
given; and that the same has not to his knowledge been introduced
into public use in the Hawaiian Islands for more
than one year; that he does not know or believe that the same
was ever before known or used, and shall state of what country
he is a citizen, and his place of residence.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_23" id="Rule_23"></a>23&mdash;The oath may be made before any person within this
Republic authorized by law to administer oaths, or when the
applicant resides in any foreign country, before any Minister,
Charge d'Affaires, Consul or Commercial Agent, holding commission
under the Hawaiian Government, or before any
Notary Public in such foreign country, the oath being attested
in all cases by the proper official seal of the officer before
whom oath is made.</p>

<p>When the oath is sworn before any official abroad, other
than a Hawaiian Consul or Agent, a certificate as to the
authority of such official must be obtained from such Consul
or Agent under his official seal and annexed thereto.</p>


<p class="rop">DRAWINGS.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_24" id="Rule_24"></a>24&mdash;The applicant for a patent is required by law to furnish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">p. 23</a></span>
drawings of his invention where the nature of the case
admits of it.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_25" id="Rule_25"></a>25&mdash;The drawings must be signed by the inventor, or his
attorney, and attested by two witnesses, and must show every
feature of the invention covered by claims.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_26" id="Rule_26"></a>26&mdash;The drawings to be in duplicate, one copy on heavy
parchment, the other copy on tracing cloth, the drawings to
be made with india ink of best quality and with pen only,
every line and letter must be black. The size of a sheet on
which a drawing is made should be exactly 10&times;15 inches, one
inch from its edges a single marginal line to be drawn, leaving
the "sight" 8&times;13 inches. Within this margin all work and
signatures must be included, one of the smaller sides of the
sheet is regarded as its top, and measuring downward from
the marginal line a space of not less than 1&frac14; inches is to be
left blank for the insertion of Title, Name, Number and Date.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_27" id="Rule_27"></a>27&mdash;The scale to which a drawing is made should be large
enough to show the mechanism without crowding, and more
than one sheet may be used, if necessary, to accomplish this
end. Letters and figures of reference should be carefully
formed, and large enough to be plainly distinguished. If the
same part of the invention appears in more than one view
of the drawing, it must always be represented by the same
character; and the same character must never be used to
designate different parts.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_28" id="Rule_28"></a>28&mdash;No agent's or attorney's stamp, or advertisement, or
written address, will be permitted upon a drawing.</p>

<p>Should the application be found incomplete under the above
rules and be returned from the Minister of the Interior for
amendment, the same must be again filed within thirty days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">p. 24</a></span>
if the applicant is a resident of the Hawaiian Islands, or
within four months if residing in a foreign country; otherwise
it will be barred, if interfering with another application
filed during the interval and covering the same invention or
improvement.</p>


<p class="rop">THE MODEL.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_29" id="Rule_29"></a>29&mdash;A model will not be required as part of the application
unless on examination of the case it shall be found to be
necessary or useful; when, if so found, the Commissioner of
Patents shall, in writing, notify the applicant, and action in
the case shall be suspended until a model is furnished.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_30" id="Rule_30"></a>30&mdash;The model must clearly exhibit every feature of the
machine which forms the subject of a claim of invention, but
should not include other matter than that covered by the
actual invention or improvement, unless it shall be necessary
to the exhibition of the invention in a working model.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_31" id="Rule_31"></a>31&mdash;The model must be neatly and substantially made of
durable material, metal being deemed preferable; but when
a material forms an essential feature of the invention, the
model will be constructed of that material.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_32" id="Rule_32"></a>32&mdash;The model must not be more than one foot in length,
width or height, unless the Commissioner of Patents shall
admit working models of complicated machines of larger
dimensions.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_33" id="Rule_33"></a>33&mdash;Models belonging to patented cases will not be taken
from the office except in the custody of a sworn employee
especially authorized by the Commissioner of Patents.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">p. 25</a></span></p>

<p class="rop">SPECIMENS.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_34" id="Rule_34"></a>34&mdash;When the invention or discovery is of a composition of
matter the applicant shall furnish a specimen of the composition
and of its ingredients sufficient in quantity for the
purpose of experiment.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_35" id="Rule_35"></a>35&mdash;In all cases where the article is not perishable a specimen
of the composition claimed, put up in proper form to be
preserved in the office must be furnished.</p>


<p class="rop">INTERFERENCES.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_36" id="Rule_36"></a>36&mdash;An interference is a proceeding instituted for the purpose
of determining the question of priority of invention between
two or more parties claiming substantially the same
patentable invention or discovery.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_37" id="Rule_37"></a>37&mdash;If an application filed appears to claim substantially
the same invention for which a <i>caveat</i> has been filed, the Commissioner
of Patents will notify the caveator to complete his
application in three months, and if upon the filing thereof it
appears to be in conflict an interference will be declared. If
the caveator fails to complete his application within the time
designated, or such further time as for cause shown may be
granted to him, the Commissioner of Patents will proceed to
examine the first named application as if there were no <i>caveat</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_38" id="Rule_38"></a>38&mdash;Each party to the interference will be required to file
a concise statement under oath showing the date of his
original conception of the invention, of illustration by drawing

***** This file should be named 22684-h.htm or 22684-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/6/8/22684/

Produced by Joe Longo and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
